Welcome! I am a Research Assistant at the Social Networks Lab, and I recently graduated with a major in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran. My research focuses on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI to address societal challenges. During my master's studies, under the supervision of [Dr. Masoud Asadpour](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=MKwwcvIAAAAJ), I analyzed social media data to explored user satisfaction in personal relationships and applied AI techniques to gain insights into complex social behaviours. Currently, I am working on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, integrating information retrieval with LLMs to improve real-time query performance and response relevance. My interests lie at the intersection of Computational Social Science, NLP, and scalable AI systems. 

<!-- Welcome! I am a Graduted Research Assistant at the Social Networks lab at the School of ECE at the University of Tehran. As a Research Assistant in AI who’s been surrounded by a great deal of data, I’ve found myself quite motivated to actively work and follow daily learning of Computational Social Science, Natural Language Processing, and Data mining. I have a genuine passion for acquiring different tools and everything that helps me delve deeper into the application of data science.

In my research, I focus on developing a new approach to evaluate user contentment in their relationship by analyzing Twitter data. I’ve been fortunate to have a wonderful supervisor on this topic, including [Dr. Masoud Asadpour](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=MKwwcvIAAAAJ). -->
